        <p>* A note about my politics(very dangerous in America today). I am not Red or Blue! I am an independent citizen who believes in provable truth and love of neighbor. The politics of the day are missing one or two of these.<br><br>* Is there a place for the people who choose to stay united? 90 million Americans don't vote. That is more than the votes either party get! Please stop fighting! We want a united country. We need a proactive government that responds to their own scientific agencies cries of warning! <br><br>* We need an intelligent President, Senate and Congress who are not only aware of real science but are willing to put life issues ahead of billionaire Oil intrests. The evidence is in and oil emissions are a major cause of global climate change. <br><br>* The Republicans regulary call me Democrat because I am an environmentalist but I take exception. I believe the environment is a universal issue. Countries around the globe have a united view of the environment. We are one of a handful of developed nations that are taking a negitive stance on the environment. This is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a Red or blue issue, it is a life or death issue!<br><br>*<strong>Democrats and Republicans take note:</strong> (not where I loose you all I hope)<br>"We the People of the United States of America", have hired all of you to do a job. If you hired a board of individuals to run your business and they divided into two groups and spent their efforts slandering each other wouldn't you fire them?<br>We want you to remember our name, "<strong>United</strong> States of America", and stop making it a R or D issue and clear out the criminals from both parties. Clean energy is the only future that gives our children a real inheritance. This infighting in the Senate and Congress is ruining the country for all of us. Only the Oil industry, the Russian government and some self-interested billionaires are coming out ahead (and even that is debatable(global climate change)) </p></div>

        <p>*<strong>The doom and gloom!</strong> Yes, we <em>very</em> close to destroying half of the habitable land on earth. Still our corporate run government is pushing our consumption over the top. Our government also has an oil agenda despite all of the <em> real, clear and easily provable</em> science stating that oil burning is over heating the earth. Also, the U.S. is just about the only nation on Earth to pull out of the Paris climate agreement and "we" have upped our carbon output by 14% during the current Trump era.<br> Sounds crazy!.....right? .....Yes, and it is!<br><br>* So, how can we have a positive attuide? Well, we are on the brink of a truely Green revolution!<br><br>*Get your dreaming caps on and follow me. We are going on a "dream of green" tour of the future.

None of us can do it alone and the scale of change coming is both daunting and enlivening. Our lives are already being lost to the tune of millions per year due to our clinging to an oily past and our fear of change but I am confident that when we see the actual possibilities for a green sustainable future we will join with the growing number of nations who are starting to embrace this green revolution and fight for everyones future by going green with vigor!<br><br>* There will be links with connections to people, right here in the U.S., who are already doing big things to help green up our country. <br>* Also links to green/sustainable products will be provided.<br>* I will verify the truth and accuracy of all articles<br>* I promise to dream big and verify and prove bigger!
